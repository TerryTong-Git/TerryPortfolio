I want to understand things intuitively and use simple tools to solve complex problems. My research currently leverages tools from robust machine learning for natural language processing. I am to answer the following questions. 

<b> Research:
- How can we ensure machine learning systems do not fail catastrophically in the wild under distribution shift?
- What are ways we can align models with human values with minimal supervision?
- How can we understand and interpret models, and allow models to understand us?
